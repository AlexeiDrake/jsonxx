h1. Introduction

JSON++ is a light-weight JSON parser written in C++.

h2. Why another JSON parser?

Perhaps because web service clients are usually written in dynamic
languages these days, none of the existing C++ JSON parsers suite my
needs very well, so I wrote one to used in another project. My goals
for JSON++ were:
* Efficient in both memory and speed.
* No third party dependencies. JSON++ only depends on the standard C++ library.
* Cross platform.
* Robust.
* Small and convenient API. Most of the time, you only need to call one function and two function templates.
