Since a few people have asked me, I figured I'd put a LICENSE file here. I wrote
this small library as an excercise. You are welcome to include jsonxx in your
project and redistributed it with your code in any license, provided that you
don't sue me for anything. Please let me know if you improved it, so that I can
merge your changes.
